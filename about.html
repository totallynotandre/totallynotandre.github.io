        About Me
      </h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
My name is Andre Smith and I graduated from University of California: Irvine with a bachelor’s degree in Informatics. I’ve only been in the Irvine area for about three years. 
My first year at UCI was remote due to COVID so it wasn’t worth the money to move down. As UCI began to transition back to in-person classes during my second year, I had to find a place to 
move to. I wasn't having luck with dorms; but luckily, I reconnected with an old family friend who convienetly was looking for one more roommate as he was trying to find an apartment at Costa Mesa. I moved in with him and his friend from our hometown.
 The rest of my second year and the entirety of my third year went by smoothly with the only issue being that I still don't have a car. The last two quarters had me finally get a car which opened up a lot of new avenues for me. Through my time within UCI, I have experience with multiple coding languages and tools that someone went down the Informatics 
 field for UI/UX and website design would use.
      </p>
      <p>
Before being an Informatics major, I was originally accepted into UCI as a software engineering major.
 I switched to Informatics as I was more interested in Human-Computer Interactions and UI/UX than outright backend coding.
  There is the added benefit of the two majors having a good amount of overlap with one another.
   A lot of the experiences I got from software engineering such as learning Java/Python can mesh with what I learned
    so far from Informatics especially if I were to make my own program or application. In Informatics so far, I’ve had experience using the likes of Figma, Webflow, and HTML/CSS.
</p>
<p>
I only became interested in Informatics, UI/UX, and HCI within the last three years. I took my first Informatic class at UCI and was curious about what it entailed. I found it more in line with what I want to do with
 my life compared to just software engineering. I wanted to work on the front-end side of development and help with designing websites or UIs. All of that isn’t to say that I didn’t enjoy software engineering, it’s more that I found Informatics as a career path not too derivative 
 from software engineering and something that I could easily see myself doing.
</p>
<p>
My desired career in the future is to work on UI/UX and Human-Computer Interaction at a company associated with video games. Despite this, I don’t mind where I initially start my career as it will serve as a pathway to my goal at the end of the day.
