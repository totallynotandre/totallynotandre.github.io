        Unity Webgame for NASA's Psyche Mission

        This was my capstone project for UCI. Me and 4 others were tasked with creating an Unity webgame for NASA's Psyche mission. Every year, NASA with assistance from Arizona State University
        will request help from colleges in order to have students make projects for the Psyche mission. They use the projects as a way to bring attention to the mission. For our group, we were tasked to make a game
        which no one had experience for. I had spent months learning how to use and code within Unity as well as incorporated my knowledge in the design parts of the project. I also learned how to use audio software such
        as FMOD Studio. Despite the short amount of time we had and the fact that we had zero experience with game design as a whole, we were able to make a short, little platforming game.

        Animation/Simulation with Python

        This project had me create a simulation within python that had objects all with different behaviors. 
        This heavily incorporated inheritance as some objects are similar due to them potentially being dependencies or parent object. 
        There are objects I can choose from at the start, and if I were to click anywhere on the screen, the object will spawn and move in a random direction granted they can move. 
        The window can also be adjusted to whatever size and the objects will still be contained and bounce off them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>The blue ball or "Prey" goes in a straight line and will bounce off walls.</li>
          <br>
          <li>The red ball or "Floater" will also bounce off walls but slowly turns as it moves forward.</li>
          <br>
          <li>The cyan ball will run away from either red balls or blue balls, but can't be destroyed.</li>
          
      </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Each black ball is a form of a hunter. 
  They will destroy either blue or red balls on contact
  but will eventually become smaller and destroy itself if they can’t find food in time depending on which object it is.
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>The first black ball will stay stationary until forcibly removed by the user.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The second black ball will also stay stationary but will remove itself if it hasn’t consumed a prey in a certain amount of iterations.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The third and final black ball will actively move towards blue or red balls. If no consumable objects are available, they will move in a straight line until it remove itself due to “hunger”.</li>
</ul>

        This project required me to make a To-Do List in Java that allowed for deadlines and sorted each item by it's priority and name lexicographically.
         You can mark individual items as done or outright delete them.

      <h2>
        Webflow Redesign of UCI Informatics Page
      </h2>
      <hr>

    <p>
      This project had me redesign parts of the UCI Informatics page from scratch to be easier to navigate and read. 
      I rearranged the site to have information about Informatics at the top of the page compared to it being at the bottom. 
      I also seperated the text hidden by images that required the user to hover over to see. 
      While it does take up more room, it allows people to at least know there is text as some people may not notice that the images lead to new pages. 
      The other page I redesigned was the B.S. Informatics page. 
      The page has been reordered so that information such as requirements or qualifications are at the top before getting to the more specific details about the major. 
      I also added a table of content that scrolls with the user so navigating the page would be even easier. 
      On both pages, I redid the dropdown menu to look more in-line with the other UCI websites, to look nicer fancier in general, and reordered the categories so that undergraduate is before graduate. 
      Undergraduate normally comes first in listing so the switch can help with reducing the odds of someone going to the wrong dropdown category. 
      </p>
      <p>
      As I only had to design parts of the website, not all of the functions the site normally has works. 
      The only option in the dropdown menu that works is the B.S. Informatics button as I needed a pathway to that page specifically. 
      It was one of the two pages I decided to redesign, but I am confident in my ability to go back add more pages if I have more time. 
      inks that do work will go to their respective page on the normal UCI Informatics site.
