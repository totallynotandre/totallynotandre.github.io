--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

13/15
- 1/1 Readme
- 3/3 Basic HTML content
- 3/3 Basic CSS styling
- 1/2 Advanced feature
- 3/3 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 1/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
Basic HTML features included are images all with alt text
links to things I talk about, mention, or things I recommend.
Multiple pages and a nav bar to get between them all.
included my own favicon

(b) CSS features
Custom Font
Custom background with modified text color, hovered text color, and hyperlink colors that I believe make a decent color palette.
I used bootstrap for responsiveness and for the grid system.
I used padding to space out blocks of text better.


(c) Advanced features
HTML embedded videos
The site should be responsive as bootstrap's grid and @media allowing me to disable text that wouldn't like smaller devices


3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

10 hours

4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)

WebDevSimplified intro to HTML (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvJYXl2ywUE&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8BoXcpCUvdmdPZFuR5y2lV&pp=iAQB)

Both videos gave me a jumping off point in which I branched out and learned bootstrap.
Bootstraps website (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/)

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

The only consultation I got was I asked my roommate how the site looked. They don't know anything about web dev so it is purely appearance discussions.



6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

This site is also less a portfolio and more a blog.
I embedded my own videos in my site and used GitHub Desktop to push it into the asset files. Don't think there is anything special needed to run the code besides that.
The text on the navbar that says "Andre's Site" with the lil icon can be clicked to go back to the index page.
Also for the accessibility guidelines, AChecker says that my hero banner's subtitle text should be a larger heading but I personally like how it looks with a smaller heading.
