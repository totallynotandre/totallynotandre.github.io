## About Me

![image][/assets/IMG_6223.jpg]{: style="float: right"}
My name is Andre Smith and I am currently working on getting a bachelor's degree in Informatics at University of California: Irvine. I've only been in the Irvine area for about a year as my first year at UCI was remote due to COVID so I never moved down. I moved to Costa Mesa which is near UCI for my second year and recently started my third year. Due to these years at UCI, I've had experiences with different coding languages and other tools that someone going down the Informatics field for UI/UX and website design would use.

Before being an Informatics major, I was originally accepted into UCI as a software engineering major. I switched to Informatics as I was more interested in Human-Computer Interactions and UI/UX then outright backend coding. There is the added benefit of the two majors having a good amount of overlap between one another. A lot of the experiences I got from software engineering such as learning Java/Python can mesh with what I learned so far from Informatics especially if I were to make my own program or application. In Informatics so far, I've had experience using the likes of Figma, Webflow, and a bit of HTML. 

I only became interested in Informatics, UI/UX, and HCI within the last two years. I took my first Informatic class at UCI and was curious in what it entailed. I found it more inline with what I want to do with my life compared to just outright software engineering. I wanted to work on the front-end side of development and help with designing website or UI's. All of that isn't to say that I didn't enjoy software engineering, its more that I found Infomratics as a career path not too derivative from software engineering and something that I could easily see myself doing.

My desired career in the future is to work on UI/UX and Human-Computer Interaction at a company associated with video games. Despite this, I don't mind where I intially start my career as it will serve as a pathway to my goal at the end of the day. 



## Website's Purpose

This website was created for mostly career use; but during it's inception, I decided it was going to also be used for personal reasons. I don't really talk about myself or post that much on any social media so having a designated place where I can have images of myself and be able to freely talk about who I am and what hobbies I have could be nice. All the work I have done with coding has been done for academic reasons so I can easily include what I have done to the website. Also the fact that this is done within GitHub allows me to share files much easier if I need to one of these days.
