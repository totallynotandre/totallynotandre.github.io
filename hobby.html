      <h2>
        My Feelings about Games
      </h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Throughout my life, whether it was little me watching my two older brothers play on their Xbox together or me eventually have the ability to function to properly hold a controller, I 
        always have fond memories of gaming. It really was the only constant in my life besides my middle brother but he couldn't be by myside forever. A family loss caused our entire family to split and I was tossed from household to household.
        The only thing that I had between each house was the consoles that my brother left me before he left to college. He couldn't take me with him to UCSD, so he gave me as much stuff and even taught me how to emulate games.
        Games have been a way for me to relieve stress, cope, connect with others, and challenge myself, which is why I feel attached to them even today. I truly am appreciative to my brother and to games as a whole.

        The Type of Games I Enjoy
      </h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        While I do have my preference in game genre, I usually am willing to branch out and try things I am unfamilliar with. A popular genre of games as of recently are rogue-likes. 
        You typically have limited tries to get to the end while you're giving random weapons and power ups. If you lose, you go back to beginning with either completely nothing or some help. 
        This help could be an unlockable they can later find or just outright get. This type of game has gotten me to try out so many different genres. From card games and deckbuilderes like <a href =  "https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/" style="color: rgb(189, 129, 219);" > Slay the Spire</a>, third-person shooters
        such as <a href = "https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/ " style="color: rgb(189, 129, 219);" >Risk of Rain 2</a>, and metroidvanias like <a href = "https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/" style="color: rgb(189, 129, 219);" > Dead Cells</a>, rogue-likes gave 
        a new found appreciation to game genres I didn't use to enjoy before. I would include images of the games, but I don't think I am allowed to and I don't want to risk anything. I'll link the games for now though.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing that gets me to branch out are friends. As long as I have someone to play with, any game could be made fun no matter how much I may not like it. The ability to experience something with a friend 
        can make anything enjoyable, even something I don't favor.
      </p>
      <h2 class = "pt-3">
        My Two Favorite Types of Game
      </h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        There are two genres of game that I absolutely love. The first being MOBAs. I genuinely love <a href = "https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/" style="color: rgb(189, 129, 219);"> League of Legends </a> even though everyone makes overdone jokes about it. I am unfazed by the toxcicity as that's any PvP game, from CoD, CSGO, or anything competitive.
        I even see cases of the Animal Crossing Community being absolute jerks to each other. I rarely ever talk in the game nor do I find that many people who flame; and if they do, I'll just mute them.
        I got into League as my brother borrowed my laptop to start playing it when I was in 4th grade. As I was the annoying youngest son, I just had to copy everything my brother did. Eventually it just stuck with me and I still play it today.
        I like how responsive the game is, the andrenline I get when I play my absolute best and make a game winning play, or just feeling of playing with my roommates. The game brought me so much good memories with my friends and my brother so I can't talk ill about it.
        If you are unfamilliar with how League functions, there are 2 teams of 5 that must compete to destroy the other's base first. Each player has a role to play in an effort to win the game, whether itâ€™s
        being the main damage dealer, someone who disrupts the other team, or someone who helps their own team.

      </p>
      <p>
        The second game genre I've grown to love is fighting games. Specifically 2D fighting games and not anything 3D such as any arena fighter. Fighting games has improved the way I look at myself and the way I take criticsm.
        A fighting game is a game between just two people and is somewhat comparable to chess. Both players want to land a hit on the other and start wailing on the other, 
        but you have to be careful if the enemy baits you into an attack. At a high level, both players are trying to read and understand what the opponent wants and is going to do. If you lose, you can't blame anyone else but yourself. The thing is, even if I lose in a way that is embarassing or if my chances in a match is 0%,
        I always have something to learn. Learning when I should be pressing buttons, how I should block, what is optimal or not, or what choices I could have made differently. I feel like I am constantly learning.
        It taught me not to beat myself up over simple mistakes when we mess up as we usually do get more than one chance at what we want to do. There are two fightings games that I play. One is 
        <a href = "https://store.steampowered.com/app/1384160/GUILTY_GEAR_STRIVE/" style="color: rgb(189, 129, 219);">Guilty Gear -Strive- </a> which is a fast-paced game where matches can and will end in under two minutes. Even if it's volatile, it was easy to get into and one of the easier fighting games in the market.
        The other game is the recently release <a href = "https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364780/Street_Fighter_6" style="color: rgb(189, 129, 219);"> Street Fighter 6.</a> I wasn't a big fan of the previous iterations, but this one just clicked with me. It's slower pased game compared to Strive, but there is so 
        much to think about that when you do make the right call, it feels so god-like. To add, I love the soundtrack to both games and most of the characters between the two games. It also encapsulates 
        some of what I love about League. I can feel like I am doing something cool and technical as I play the game and also feel satisfaction. I also got a cool controller to play fighting games with.

        Gaming Events that I went to
      </h2>
      <hr>
      <h3 class = "fw-bold pb-2">
        <u>League of Legends 2022 Worlds Finals</u>
      </h3>
      <p> 
        Everything culminates to Fall of 2022 and Summer of 2023. In 2022 and after 8 years since the last time it was hosted in the USA, the League of Legends Worlds championship finally was hosted in the country.
        What's even better is that the location of the Finals was in the Chase Center at San Fransisco. It could have been better if it was LA like how it was when I went in 2016, but it was a drivable distance. My friends,
        my brother, and I attempted to get tickets and managed to come out with 8. What's interesting is that the day before Worlds' Finals was me and roommates date to move in to our new apartment. The date couldn't be changed,
        so it was a big scramble to get our stuff to the new place. It didn't help that we were wildly unprepared and didn't pack as much as we thought we did. Besides that, we got to San Fransisco the day after
        as we stayed the night at our hometown before continuing the drive.

      </p>
      <p>
        The event itself was great. Once we arrived after nearly 4 hours of driving, it unfortunately started sprinkling but that didn't stop our enjoyment of the event. There were many different 
        streamers, professional players, and ex-players who were there that I got to meet and talk to. There was little games and booths to go to as well before the matches started. One booth were giving away goodie bags,
        the other was making badges for players that had their profile information, and photo booth areas including a weird panning picture and an area that has a mural on the ground so a picture can be taken from above.
        The arena was huge and the best part was the matches itself. The pre-show started with a song performance from Lil' Nas X. It's a weird collaboration, but he made a song for the game and it quickly became something iconic for 
        my roommates and me.
      </p>
        <p>
        To give details that doesn't need knowledge of the game, the finals consisted of the fan-favorite T1 who was believed to win the whole tournament versus 
        an underdog team DRX who was one of the lowest seeds. Even more stakes was given to this match as one of the players on DRX named Deft was always in the shadows of T1's Faker. They went to the same High School and 
        both were really good at the game, but only Faker got recognition. As they both entered the competitive scene, Faker was the one who got worldwide recognition.
        This tournament was Deft's chance to earn the recognition he wanted. The start of the set between the two was actually pretty lackluster. The first game was a stomp in the favor of T1 and Faker. It was the same for game 2 as well.
        I was scared that we travelled all this way only for a boring finals, but thankfully I was proven wrong. The third game started rough for DRX, but they slowly crawled their way back and stole their first victory from T1. 
        From here on out, the crowd was electric. I wish I had recordings still, but any little thing that happened in the games from here on out had intense crowd reactions and I couldn't help but join in with their chants, gasp, and overall excitement. 
        The next two games were neck and neck with any wrong move meaning defeat. It was almost impossible to tell who was going to win until the very end. Most fights that were taken was extremely close. I was on the edge of my seat and so was everyone who went with me that day.
        Ultimately, DRX was able to steal game 5, cementing DRX and Deft as world champions. The first underdogs in League history to make it all the way to the end. Even if it is insignificant in the grand schemes of things,
        this event is something very memorable for me and I am glad I got experience it all with my brothers and my roommates. I do have some images that I'd like to share though.

        <u>Evolution 2023</u>
      </h3>
      <p> 
        As summer of 2023 approached, I joked with some of my roommates who are interested in fighting games about going to Evolution 2023 and one of them actually called the bluff. He even offered to even drive us.
        Of course I couldn't not take the offer so we went ahead and bought tickets around a couple months prior to August 6th. Evolution 2023 or Evo for short is the largest fighting game tournament in the world. Many people 
        from all around the globe meet in Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas to compete in different games to find out who is the best. This year had over 7000 people enter the tournement for Street Fighter 6, while other games like Guilty Gear -Strive- had around 2000-4000.
        I was beyond excited to go this year as it would be my first time going to a fighting game tournament and the largest one at that. It was a three day tournament and we were there for the second day and finals day.
        This experience was one of the best in my life. It was akin to the Worlds 2022 experience, but the more grassroots approach to fighting games made it feel more personal. I got to talk to people, play sets against others, try Project L,
        and I got a great amount of merch. Two things stand out the most though, the finals was amazing and I got to meet and talk to streamers and players that I watch.

        While there were matches during the second day, the finals day was the best. There were four games left and all of them were left to Top 6. The order was Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, Tekken 7, Guilty Gear -Strive-, then Street Fighter 6.
        The order is determined by least amount of entrants to most amount of entrants. There is not much to write about for Marvel 3 as someone rolled through the entirety of top 6. Tekken is 
        the first game that was somewhat exciting to me. Tekken as a game is hard to understand, but it is an amazing spectator experience. You don't need to understand what is happening, you only want 
        to see the cool juggle combos and the movement. It's tense as it feels as one hit could end it all for either side. The next game played is my favorite. Guilty Gear is the game that truly got me into
        fighting games. It's easy to pick up and gives me a lot of freedom to decide how I want to play. The systems of the game allows the player to cancel moves in exchange of resources which allows
        anyone to essentially freeform and do whatever they want. The top 6 for -Strive- was great with close calls across the board. Some people will think the ending is anti-climatic as the strongest
        character in the game won, but I digress. The final top 6 was for Street Fighter 6. It is understatement to say that it was great. It was amazing. Each match is a best of 5 and each of them went to either game 4 or game 5. 
        Everyone seemed evenly matched and it was spectacle to watch. During intermissions, Capcom had a bad playing the soundtrack to Street Fighter 6. It was an amazing time and I even got free Chipotle. The final set
        had a bracket reset and went to essentially game 9. After a real close final round and a couple of errors by one of the players, a victor was crowned. The energy of crowd rivaled the World 2022 crowd 
        and I just had the urge to cheer alongside them. If they started singing, I'd join in. If they started waving their lights like a concert, I'll be there. I have a couple of videos and you can hear
        how energetic the crowd is. It's hard to put my feelings into words and I may be waffling on, but both fighting games and even League made me feel a part of something great.
